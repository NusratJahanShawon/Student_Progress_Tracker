# Student_Progress_Tracker

Overview
The Student Progress Tracker is a simple command-line Python application that allows users to manage student records. Users can add, view, and delete student names and grades. It also provides statistical analysis of the grades, including the average, highest, and lowest grades. The data is stored in a text file (CSV format), ensuring that the information persists between sessions.
